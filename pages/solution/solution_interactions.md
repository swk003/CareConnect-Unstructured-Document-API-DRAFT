## Interactions ##

The API uses the ‘Get Binary Retrieval Pattern’ to support retrieval of non-structured documents such as a PDFs from remote systems.

There are three main systems that need to integrate in order for systems to share data.


| System | Role in Get Structured Document solution | 
|-----------|----------------|
|Consumer|A system that wishes to retrieve an unstructured document to support patient healthcare.|
|Provider|A system that exposes records (unstructured document) for sharing (retrieval).|
|Spine Security Proxy (SSP)|The Spine Security Proxy can facilitate retrieval of unstructured documents [TBC].|


### Consumer System ###

A Consumer system can only read unstructured documents from Providers. A Provider allows a Consumer to retrieve an unstructured document to support patient healthcare.

### Provider System ###

A Provider system is responsible for exposing its records for sharing with Consumer systems. It controls the format of and the way a record can be retrieved. This API limits shared records to “non-structured” document format.
