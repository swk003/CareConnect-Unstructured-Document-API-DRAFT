## Get Binary Retrieval Pattern ##

The Get Unstructured Document FHIR STU3 ‘Read Only’ API uses the ‘Get Binary Retrieval Pattern’ to support retrieval of non-structured documents such as a PDFs from remote systems.

Non-structured documents can be served on the FHIR REST interface in 2 ways:

1.  FHIR resource - the utility FHIR Binary resource is used to convey the non-structured document because it cannot be expressed natively in FHIR.
2.  Native non-encoded form - when a FHIR Binary resource is initially created it must be encoded (XML/JSON), however a Consumer system can retrieve it in its native non-encoded form e.g. PDF. 
The FHIR Binary resource represents the data of a single raw artefact as digital content accessible in its native format.

‘Non-Structured’ documents can be any content that is not represented using FHIR resources (e.g. PDFs, PNGs, Work Documents etc).

## FHIR Elements ##

<p>The following FHIR elements have been identified as key to the implementation:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Cardinality</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Binary.id</td><td>0..1</td><td>id</td><td>Mandatory Logical id of Binary resource. Assigned by Provider. Uniquely identifies the document. Used by Consumers to retrieve document.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Binary.contentType</td><td>1..1</td><td>code</td><td>MimeType of the binary content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Binary.content</td><td>1..1</td><td>Base64Binary</td><td>The actual content</td>
</tr>
</table>






## Read ##

FHIR Binary resources behave differently to all other FHIR resources on the RESTful API. There are 2 ways clients can make FHIR Binary resource read requests:

1) When a read request is made for the FHIR binary resource that doesn't explicitly specify a content type (expressed as mime type), then the content MUST be returned using the content type stated in the resource. e.g. if the content type in the resource is `application/pdf`, then the content MUST be returned as a PDF directly. This is referred to in this API as the native non-encoded form (i.e. the retrieved document is as a standard URL resource and not contained within a FHIR resource) and is implemented using the Default Read Operation.

2) When a read request is made for the FHIR binary resource that explicitly specifies the content type (expressed as mime type) of the response either via a `_format` override on the query parameter or by using an `Accept` HTTP header in the request, then the content MUST be returned as a FHIR Binary resource - i.e. XML/JSON representation. This is implemented in a number of ways.

The HL7 standard states that "the intent is that unless specifically requested, the FHIR XML/JSON representation is not returned". 

The Get Unstructured Document API must follow the FHIR STU3 standard. So although a Binary resource can be retrieved from any url, a Provider server (FHIR Binary endpoint) MUST serve up the resource either as a `FHIR binary resource` or in its `native non-encoded form` on the rest interface. The default behaviour is that of the latter.

### Read Request Headers ###

Read requests support the following HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |Conformance |
|----------------------|-------|-------|
| `Accept`      | The `Accept` header indicates the format of the response the client is able to understand. | MAY |
| `Authorization`      | The `Authorization` header will carry the base64url encoded JSON web token. |  MUST |

<!--
, this will be one of the following <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/fhir+json</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/fhir+xml</code>. See the RESTful API [Content types](development_general_api_guidance.html#content-types) section.

| `fromASID`           | Client System ASID | MUST |
| `toASID`             | The Spine ASID | MUST |
-->

### Default Read Operation - with No HTTP Accept Header ###

A client makes a read request for a FHIR binary resource that doesn't explicitly specify a content type. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
GET [baseUrl]/Binary/[id]</div>

The server returns the content using the `native mime type of the document` e.g. PDF – No FHIR Binary resource is returned.

<font color="red"> Provider Systems <b>MUST</b> support this query construct.</font>

### Read Operation Format Override (Method #1) - with No HTTP Accept Header###

A client makes a read request for a FHIR binary resource using the `_format` override on the query parameter to specify a specific content type. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
GET [baseUrl]/Binary/[id]?_format=[format] </div>

The server returns a FHIR Binary resource in the requested format with the document `base64` encoded within the FHIR Binary content element. 

<font color="red"> Provider Systems <b>MUST</b> support this query construct.</font>



### Read Operation Format Override (Method #2) - with a HTTP Accept Header of [format]###

A client makes a read request for a FHIR binary resource using the `Accept` HTTP Header to specify a specific content type.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
GET [baseUrl]/Binary/[id]</div>

The server returns a FHIR Binary resource in the requested format with the document `base64` encoded within the FHIR Binary content element. 


<font color="red"> Provider Systems <b>SHOULD</b> support this query construct.</font>



### Read Operation Format Override (Method #3) - with a HTTP Accept Header of [format_2]###

A client makes a read request for a FHIR binary resource using the `_format`=[format_1] override on the query parameter and a `Accept` HTTP Header =[format_2]. [format_1] and [format_2] specify different content types.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
GET [baseUrl]/Binary/[id]?_format=[format_1] </div>

The server returns a FHIR Binary resource as per [format_1] as `_format` overrides the `Accept` HTTP Header. The document is `base64` encoded within the FHIR Binary content element. 


<font color="red"> Provider Systems <b>SHOULD</b> support this query construct.</font>




## Read Response ##

A full set of response codes can be found here <a href="profiles_api_codes.html">API Response Codes</a>. FHIR Servers SHALL support the following response codes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>HTTP Response</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
      <th>Cause</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>200</td>
      <td>OK</td>
      <td>Request processed successfully – Provider system returns Binary Resource matching the query criteria of the request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>403</td>
      <td>Forbidden</td>
     <td>Provider system refused to action request. This might be due to Consumer system not having the necessary permissions to access the Resource.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>404</td>
      <td>Not found</td>
     <td>Unknown URI - Provider system unable to find requested Resource.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>410</td>
      <td>Gone</td>
       <td>The requested Binary resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>415</td>
      <td>Unsupported Media Type</td>
     <td>The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>500</td>
      <td>Unexpected internal server error</td>
     <td>The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!--
## 2. Search ##

The Get Unstructured Document API and FHIR STU3 Standard do not support searching on Binary resources. 

The binary is not searchable as the other API resources are, however, please refer to [DocumentReference](api_documents_documentreference.html){:target="_blank"} for a mechanism to gain access to Binary information through a API.
